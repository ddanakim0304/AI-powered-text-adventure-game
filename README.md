## The Story

It all began with a tweet—a solemn announcement of the extinction of the **Slender-billed Curlew** (*Numenius tenuirostris*). The thought of the last of its kind soaring through a silent, unresponsive world struck a deep chord within me. I wanted to give life to this poignant narrative and allow others to experience it firsthand.

So, in just **6 hours**, I crafted **Birdy's Journey**, a text-based adventure game that immerses you in the world of Birdy, the last Slender-billed Curlew.

## About the Project

Leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and the concept of **Hierarchical Content Generation (HCG)**, I built a game that generates dynamic narratives and interactions based on your choices.

### Key Technologies:

- **Python**: The foundation of the game.
- **Llama 3 via Together API**: For natural language generation and content creation.
- **Hierarchical Content Generation (HCG)**: To structure the game's narrative and maintain coherence.
- **Gradio**: For creating an interactive user interface.

### Features:

- **Dynamic Storytelling**: The game's narrative evolves with each decision you make.
- **Game State Management**: Keeps track of your interactions, inventory, and relationships.
- **Interactive NPCs**: Engage with other creatures, each with their own personalities and stories.

## Stay Tuned

This is just the beginning! I plan to expand the game, adding more depth to Birdy's world and her interactions. Feedback and contributions are welcome.
