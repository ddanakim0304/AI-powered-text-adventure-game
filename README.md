# LLM-based Adventure Game

This repository contains a text-based RPG game developed as part of my learning journey in the **[Building an AI-Powered Game](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/building-an-ai-powered-game/)** course by DeepLearning.AI. The course introduced the integration of LLM models like Llama for creating interactive storytelling game.

## About the Project

I used the foundational code from the course to create my own adventure game. However, I updated and customized the game content and mechanics to align with my creative vision.

This project is still in development, and I plan to further refine both the game logic and narrative.
